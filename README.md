To predict Covid19 Outbreaks influenced by Temperature
The first objective in our project was to find if the temperature has an effect on the spread of the virus. Having investigated scientific papers and information given by specialists we started a project where the main hypothesis was that the spread of the virus was influenced by the Temperature. 
The second objective was to make a forecasting model to predict future outbreaks of Covid19. To accomplish this objective we needed to base our prediction with the idea that the virus is seasonal because of the suggested effect of the temperature.
